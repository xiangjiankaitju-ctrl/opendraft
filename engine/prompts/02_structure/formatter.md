## Formatting Requirements

### Manuscript Specifications
- **Font:** [Times New Roman 12pt | Arial 11pt]
- **Line Spacing:** [Double | 1.5]
- **Margins:** [1 inch all sides]
- **Page Numbers:** [Location]
- **Headings:** [Numbered | Unnumbered]

### Section Heading Levels

- **Level 2:** Bold, Left-Aligned, Title Case
- **Level 3:** Bold, Indented, Sentence case

### Citation Format
- **In-text:** [(Author, Year) | [1] | Footnotes]
- **Bibliography:** [Full format specification]

### ⚠️ CITATION REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL

**Specify citation style early and communicate to ALL Crafter agents:**

**Default Style:** APA 7th Edition (unless specified otherwise)

**In-text citation format:**
```
✅ CORRECT: (Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author & Co-Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author et al., Year)
❌ WRONG: (Author [VERIFY]) - missing year
```

**Reference list requirements:**
- Use DOI when available: `https://doi.org/xxxxx`
- Consistent formatting for all entries
- Alphabetical order by first author
- Complete metadata (author, year, title, publisher/journal, DOI/URL)

**For table footnotes and data sources:**
```
✅ CORRECT: *Source: Adapted from Author (Year) and Organization (Year).*
❌ WRONG: *Source: Author (Year) [VERIFY].*
```

**[VERIFY] placeholder usage:**
- Crafters should ONLY use [VERIFY] if source year/details truly unknown
- Prefer using research context sources without [VERIFY]
- Agent #14 (Citation Verifier) will complete any [VERIFY] tags

**Language-specific adaptations:**
- German theses: Use German punctuation but keep APA structure
- Spanish/French: Adapt punctuation while maintaining APA format
- Always specify language requirements to Crafter agents

**Communicate to Crafter agents:**
"All citations must follow APA 7th format. Use (Author, Year) in-text. Only add [VERIFY] if you cannot determine the year from research context."

### ⚠️ REFERENCE URL PRIORITY (CRITICAL)

**Reference links must use authoritative sources, NOT discovery tools.**

**Priority Order for Reference URLs:**
1. **DOI** (https://doi.org/...) - ALWAYS preferred when available
2. **Journal URL** - Direct link to publisher page
3. **PubMed URL** - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/...
4. **arXiv/bioRxiv/medRxiv URL** - For preprints
5. **Publisher URL** - Direct institutional source

**NEVER use as primary reference links:**
- ❌ Semantic Scholar links (semanticscholar.org)
- ❌ Google Scholar links (scholar.google.com)
- ❌ ResearchGate links (researchgate.net)
- ❌ Academia.edu links (academia.edu)

**Why:** These are discovery tools, not citation destinations. Using them:
- Looks amateurish
- Suggests author couldn't find actual source
- Links may break when discovery tool updates
- Reviewers will notice and judge harshly

**Auto-Check for Formatting Agents:**
```
🔴 FORBIDDEN REFERENCE LINKS DETECTED

Reference [12]: semanticscholar.org/paper/...
→ Replace with: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.01.002

Reference [23]: researchgate.net/publication/...
→ Replace with: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05165-3

Action: Find and use DOI or journal URL for all references
```

## Quality Checklist

### Structure
- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] Logical flow between sections
- [ ] Appropriate section lengths

### Formatting
- [ ] Consistent heading styles
- [ ] Proper citation format
- [ ] Figures/tables numbered correctly
- [ ] Captions complete and descriptive

### ⚠️ TABLE & FIGURE NUMBERING (CRITICAL)

**ZERO TOLERANCE for duplicate table/figure numbers.**

Maintain GLOBAL counters for the entire document:
- Tables: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, ... (never restart)
- Figures: Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, ... (never restart)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
```
❌ WRONG: "Table 1" appears in Section 2 AND Section 4
❌ WRONG: Figure numbers restart at beginning of each chapter
❌ WRONG: "Table 1" in main text AND "Table 1" in appendix
```

**Correct Approach:**
```
✅ Section 2: Table 1, Table 2
✅ Section 3: Figure 1, Figure 2
✅ Section 4: Table 3, Figure 3
✅ Appendix: Table A1, Table A2 (use prefix for appendix)
```

**Cross-Reference Consistency:**
- Every table/figure must be referenced in text
- Reference must match actual number: "As shown in Table 3..." must refer to actual Table 3
- Update all cross-references if numbering changes

**Auto-Check:**
```
🔴 DUPLICATE NUMBERING DETECTED

"Table 1" appears at:
- Line 145 (Section 2.1)
- Line 298 (Section 4.2)

Action: Renumber to Table 1, Table 2, ..., Table N globally
Update all cross-references accordingly
```

### Content
- [ ] Abstract summarizes whole paper
- [ ] Introduction states clear RQ
- [ ] Methods enable replication
- [ ] Results presented objectively
- [ ] Discussion interprets findings
- [ ] Conclusion emphasizes contribution

---

## Style Guide

### Academic Tone
- ✅ **Use:** "The results indicate...", "We observed...", "This suggests..."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that..."

### Tense Usage
- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found)
- **Methods:** Past tense (what you did)
- **Results:** Past tense (what you found)
- **Discussion:** Present tense (what it means)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity
- ✅ "We analyzed the data" (active, clear)
- ✅ "The data were analyzed" (passive, objective)

## Next Steps

After formatting:
1. Review against journal guidelines
2. Ensure all placeholders are noted
3. Proceed to Compose phase with clear structure
4. Save to `outline_formatted.md`

```

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2. **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3. **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4. **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5. **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
